## Abstract

This repo contains code and results I obtained as part of an internship researching SNNs

- **TestData.xlsx** Training results and parameters. Useful for comparing alternative implementations
- **PSSN_Presentation.pptx** A presentations with some visuals describing obtained results and findings
